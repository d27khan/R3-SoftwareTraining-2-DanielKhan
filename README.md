# R3-SoftwareTraining-2-DanielKhan
 This is my second submission for R3 software team
## Overview
For this training module we were required to create a maze in python using the pygame package. First I created the grid and then I used Prim's algorithm to carve out the maze.
  
## Process  
since it was my first time working with prim's algorithm, I had some difficulty implementing it in python. Some of the implemetation is not completly functional there are some bugs that need to be looked at in detail however I could not figure them out with the time given.

## Task 2

For this task we were required to to create a send and receive Program to read the solution array in maze.py and send the path a robot would have to take to reach the end. I had some difficulty connecting the two ends of the of the socket and could not get the correct however the logic seems to be correct.
